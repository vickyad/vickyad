### Hello, world!

I fell in love with the area in high school when I went to peek on a Hackaton. Since then, I have been discovering more about this rich and dynamic universe. 
I have a lot of fun with the frontend development, but I also love the theoretical and historical part of Computing.

### That's me
```Python
class VictoriaDuarte:
  def __init__(self):
    self.pronoum = ['she', 'they']
    self.skills = ['C', 'Python', 'JS', 'TS', 'React', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'Figma', 'Photoshop']
    self.learning = ['C++', 'Java']
 
  def routine(self):
     drink(coffee)
     code()
    
    
 myself = VictoriaDuarte()
 
 while(true):
     myself.routine()
```
